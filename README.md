This is an instructor notes app, where we have 5 instructors. You can follow/unfollow them. Whenever they post something new, you'll be notified of their post and it'll also be added to your app.

The backend is hosted here - https://squawkerfcmserver.udacity.com/

You need to make a firebase project and add a server key there, publish posts and send notifications to your users.
